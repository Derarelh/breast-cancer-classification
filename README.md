# Breast cancer classification

## Description

The objectif of this project is to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous) using Machine Learning models.

## Dataset

We are using  [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). Its features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
